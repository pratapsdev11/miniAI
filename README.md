# miniAI 
These are some very few basic and initial spervised machine learning projects with small and simmple datasets. I created these projects either with the help from youtube vids or some blogs and articles , while learning some  concepts of machinne learninng and datascience.Almost every projects in this folder can be divided into three parts 
first importing and checking the data, second analysing the features of data(like how correlated different features are) and third scaling(optinal) and implementing the machine learning models. Implemention of concepts while learning helped me develop better understanding of machine learning .
