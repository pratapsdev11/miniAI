# miniAI 
This repository contains a collection of basic and initial supervised machine learning projects. These projects are designed with small, preprocessed, and simple datasets, making them ideal for learning fundamental concepts of machine learning and data science. Each project typically follows a structure that includes data import and checking, feature analysis, and the implementation of machine learning models. Additionally, some projects may include scaling (optional) and deployment on local hosts using libraries like Streamlit.

## Project Structure

Each project in this repository follows a similar structure:

1. **Data Import and Checking:**
   - Importing and checking the dataset.
   - Initial exploration of the data.

2. **Feature Analysis:**
   - Analyzing the features of the dataset.
   - Exploring correlations between different features.

3. **Machine Learning Implementation:**
   - Scaling (optional) and implementing various machine learning models.
   - Evaluating model performance.

4. **Deployment (Some Projects):**
   - Deployment of the project on local hosts.
   - Usage of libraries like Streamlit for deployment.


## Usage

Feel free to explore the projects in this repository to understand and implement basic concepts of machine learning. Each project folder includes its own README with specific instructions, datasets, and implementation details.
